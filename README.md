# Advent of Code 2024 in Rust

</div>

These are my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2024.

My plan is to get the first star each day and only go for the second if I feel like it.

I will first solve the problem myself. I will then compare my result to [Chris Biscardi's solution](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWtPciJ1UMuBABpu6LeP0ZZnvpVMRZvGc) to see how a more seasoned Rust developer would have approached the problem.

## Usage

Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

The Advent of Code input is under a restricted license and isn't in this repository. You'll need to grab the input yourself and place it, for example, under `day01/input.txt` and `day01/check.txt`.

In the root of the repository, run

`cargo run -p day01 --bin part1`
