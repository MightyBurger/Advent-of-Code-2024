# Advent of Code 2024 in Rust

</div>

These are my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2024.

My plan is to get the first star each day and only go for the second if I feel like it.

I will first solve the problem myself. I will then compare my result to [Chris Biscardi's solution](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWtPciJ1UMuBABpu6LeP0ZZnvpVMRZvGc) to see how a more seasoned Rust developer would have approached the problem.
